# Day 16 Summary.

Day 16 finally tackles the lesson about Object Oriented Programming.
OOP refers to implementation of programming to  real-world entinties
like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming. to make
sure that data are only accessible only from the function.

in this leeson we turned the previous project to an OOP. the files was
provided from the lesson and so does the classes and the aim was to
re-create the program by using the provided classes without modifying
them. what I created was basically a carbon copy of what dr. angela
created which is not surprising since it was the task anyway.
