# Day 6 Summary.

Day 6 tackles the lesson about creating functions and how to properly
use and call them. it also talks about the implementation of the while
loop.

I scratched my brain trying to figure this out on my own, thought to
myself that I up to the challenge as I thought just because I can't
properly thought of a proper resolution without copying one aspect from
Dr. Angelas code.

anyway I tried to make it original as much as possible, its a bit
longer but its my own.
