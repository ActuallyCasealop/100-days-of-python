# Day 7 Summary.

Day 7 Tackles the topic about how to interate within a range or a list
and compare them to a variable; pretty self explanatory. it also talks
about how to breakdown a task to a more manageable pieces that you can
work on over time that can commulatively complete the task.

most of the resolution I just came up or learned up through the internet;
or something I've alredy learned. I didn't stick to the fundamentals and
just winged it since it has already been two days overdue,
busy at work and life hahaha

anyway here it is.
