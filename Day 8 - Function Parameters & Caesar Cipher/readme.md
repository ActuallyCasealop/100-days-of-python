# Day 8 Summary.

day 8 expands on the use of functions and how it can take inputs,
the positional and keyword arguments.

Dr. Angela's solution for the problem was to duplicate the alphabet
lengths so I tried a different approach in solving the issue. but it
is still far from being perfect because if a user typed in any number
larger than 26 then it'll return to an exception which is weird
because in the first place why do you want to shift your letter that
much when the alphabet literally is only 26 letters long anyway.
