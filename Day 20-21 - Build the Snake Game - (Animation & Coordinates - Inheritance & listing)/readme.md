# Day 20-21 Summary.

this mini project is bundled in two seperate day but I figured I'd
just combine them into one.

this project encompasses class inheritance, and how you can also
inherit objects and methods from other classes, slicing tupples and
list and combining all of the information into creating the a simple
snake game.
