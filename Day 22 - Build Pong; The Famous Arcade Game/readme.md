# Day 22 Summary.

Day 22 is about applying the knowledge that you have gained on the previous
lesson to create the ping-pong game, and while I did just that making sure
that every steps of the way is authentic to me as possible bled my mind in
all honesty, debugging and fixing the code, thinking of sulutions and all.

and while the course goes through a more simpler approach, mine is entirely
different while still executing the same task but at this points its potato-
potato. it works and I did hat it asked of it :>
