# Day 15 Summary.

another fun task that was provided by Dr. angela, the lesson of
the day was provided in the form of a PDF where we need to go on
and create a functional coffee machine that performs the listed
function.

same as the other past few days that she only provided what needs
to be done and after proceed to go on and check on how she could've
tackled it; comparing my code to her just goes to show how brutalist
mine are but more or less the same code and same lines.
