# Day 1 Summary.

Day 1 is the basics of the basics. tackling the topics about variables,
how to store and read user inputs, string manipulation and whatnot.

originally Dr. Angela recommends using replit but for the sake of
documentation and also because I prefer using VS code I'll just go on
and copy some of the instructions from there. its also only up to day 15
where replit will be used anyway.

I'll try to stick to her format as much as possible for authenticity sake
as if I'm following along live, just like when starting out.
