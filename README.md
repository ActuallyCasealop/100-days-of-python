# 100-days-of-python
my journey in learning Dr. Angela Yu's: 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.

I initially started out this journey of mine actually way back on january 1, 2022 and managed to complete up until day 32
where I stopped completely. along the way I did also start learning other programming languages like Java and C++ which
took my attention out from continueing and finishing this course.

today I want to start from the scratch and properly document everything along the way, I'll be skipping some that I've
already learn or just proceed to create the project of that day and move on to the next one just so that I have every
projects and learning materials freshen up :)
