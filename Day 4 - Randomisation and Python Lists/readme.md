# Day 4 Summary.

Day 4 tackles how to use the random module in genrating random integers or choices.
it also tackles how to create and manipulate list and working on nested list.

funny thing, I was stumped on how to create the rock paper scissor (RPS) project and
on how to convert the user string input and find it within a list of choices of RPS
as the name of the choices themselves equals to their own respective ASCII art.

but then I realize that I dont have to make it that complicated and just stick to the
basic and just make the input numbers. did make me think for a couple of minutes though.
